# Getting Support

If you encounter any errors when using the SDK:

1. Look for related open issues in [github issues](href to https://github.com/forcedotcom/java-sdk/issues).
1. If there are no related open issues, create a new issue.

The development team monitors these issues.

If you have general questions that are not answered in the documentation, post on <http://stackoverflow.com> and tag your post with both "<code>database.com</code>" and "<code>java</code>".
