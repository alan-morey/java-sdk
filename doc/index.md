#Database.com Java SDK reference documentation

Welcome to the Database.com Java SDK reference documentation.

Database.com is the cloud database that powers Force.com and all the applications built on the platform, including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Chatter from salesforce.com.

If you are a Force.com developer, you are already using Database.com. The cloud database manages the data model for your application, stores all data and automatically exposes your data through APIs.
